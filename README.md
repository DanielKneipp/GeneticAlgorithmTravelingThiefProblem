# Genetic Algorithm for The Traveling Thief Problem
The Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) [1] is a combination of two well-known problems in
computer sciency: the Knapsack Problem (KP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

This project is trying to develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that solves instances of TTP (model 1) provided by [2].
